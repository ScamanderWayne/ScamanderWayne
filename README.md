Hello, I am @ScamanderWayne
dunno how you ended up here, but this README is written on 01/01/2024, so if you are from far future it is very plausible I am completely different person.
But if you are interested in my current, or from your perspective past, self. Here we go.

ScamanderWayne is student of small economic high school in Czech Republic.
Programming is his hobby in which he is not too good.
Currently my all experience is coding in LaTeX (and not very good), Scratch (as a little, dunno if I could even create something now) and trying modding Gothic games, written in Daedalus, which is deriverate from C something, IIRC

As I am writing this I do not even know what I am doing here.
